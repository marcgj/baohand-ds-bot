# bao-hand Discord Bot 
This is a Discord Bot made with [DiscordJda](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer).

### List of features:
 - Music
   - Youtube Search
   - Youtube Playlists
   - Loop
   - Nice Queue
 - Ranking (Disabled) 

### Deploying
The deploying solution is up to you but I mainly used two approaches, Heroku with its Maven plugin and Compiling and running the .jar inside a Docker container.
